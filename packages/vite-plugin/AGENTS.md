# @canvas-commons/vite-plugin

The Vite plugin that wires a Canvas Commons project into a dev server: it
discovers projects, serves the editor, intercepts scene and metadata imports,
proxies CORS-restricted assets, generates settings and project manifests, and
coordinates the WebGL preview. Every downstream project that runs `vite` against
Canvas Commons goes through this plugin.

See the [root `AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for repo-wide standards.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm vite-plugin:dev     # tsdown --watch
pnpm vite-plugin:build   # tsdown, outputs to lib/
pnpm --filter @canvas-commons/vite-plugin run test
pnpm --filter @canvas-commons/vite-plugin run lint:pkg
```

Unit tests cover path sandbox helpers. End-to-end behavior is exercised through
`pnpm template:dev`, `pnpm examples:dev`, and the e2e suite.

## Where things live

The default export is a function returning an array of Vite `Plugin` objects.
Each partial in `partials/` is one Vite plugin; the factory wires them together.

Peer dependency: `vite` `^4 || ^5 || ^7 || ^8`. Bumping the range is a
breaking-ish change for downstream consumers and needs a changeset.

Optional dependency: `node-pty` powers the in-editor terminal. It requires
native build tools; if it fails to load, the Terminal tab reports an error.

## Traps

**Not a general-purpose Vite helper.** It owns specific virtual modules (scenes,
projects, meta, settings) and a custom dev-server protocol the editor talks back
to. Reordering or removing partials will break the editor's handshake.

**The `editor` config option is a module path, not a file path.** It's resolved
through Node module resolution. Downstream projects almost never override it;
the default points at `@canvas-commons/editor`.

**`buildForEditor: true` is for the in-repo template setup only.** Downstream
projects shouldn't set it; they consume a prebuilt editor.

**FS and terminal APIs are sandboxed to `config.root`.** Never resolve
user-supplied paths without `resolveSandboxedPath` / `resolveSandboxedRealPath`.
The IDE UI must not invent alternate write endpoints that skip the sandbox.

## Don't touch without thinking

- The Vite plugin list and ordering in `src/main.ts`. Partials assume an order.
- The names of virtual modules (`@canvas-commons/scenes`, etc.). Scene authors
  import them indirectly via the JSX runtime and code transforms.
- The peer-dep version range in `package.json`. Widening it without testing
  means downstream breakage.
- The `/__canvas-commons-fs` routes and `/__canvas-commons-terminal` WebSocket.
  The editor IDE depends on those exact paths (not Vite HMR custom events).
